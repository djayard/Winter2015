WINDOWS:
    1) Download the cmake gui for Windows,                  http://www.cmake.org/download/
    2) Download the GTK library, I used all-in-one bundle,  http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php
        Extract it somewere
	
    3) Have MingW,
            you probably have it through QT             C:\Qt\Tools\mingw491_32
            or, you need to download it,                http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
	
	4) Go to the Windows system panel,		    Control Panel\System and Security\System
        Click on 'advance system settings',
        Click on 'Environment Variables',
        Under user variable,
            modify the PATH variable (or create it)
            add the bin directories of mingw and GTK,
                For example,
                    Variable name: PATH
                    Variable value: C:\GTK\bin; C:\Qt\Tools\mingw491_32\bin

        Be sure to hit OK to save the environment settings

LINUX and MAC:
    1) get the cmake gui installed through your terminal/command-prompt
         Example:
            for Mac, sudo port install cmake +gui
            for Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install cmake-gui

    2) You may need to install other packages if cmake complains of missing
        dependencies during Configuration

For all:
    1) Download fluidsynth, http://sourceforge.net/projects/fluidsynth/files/
        Unzip the folder
    2) Launch the CMake gui,
    3) In CMake, for source directory, select the fluidsynth-1.1.6 folder.
    4) In CMake, for build directory, pick any folder, but I recommend selecting an empty folder.
    5) In CMake, press the configure button,
        on Windows, select MinGW Makefiles
        on Mac and Linux, select UNIX Makefiles
    6) If no errors, hit Generate.
    7) In a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the build directory you selected
    8)  On Linux and Mac, enter command:	make install
        On Windows, enter command:		mingw32-make install
    9) Done! Try to compile fortedit.pro in QT.
